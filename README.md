### Control Arduino through a multi-featured user interface.

This app basically sends commands to a HC-05 Bluetooth module (which is assumed to be connected to Arduino). It has a Button Control, a Analog Joystick and Voice Control.

I created this project for my science week project (which was a robot) and hence sends my designated commands to the module, you can always change the code tho.
